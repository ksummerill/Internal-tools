# Internal-tools

I wrote this script to help folks on the Customer Success and Business teams understand what products our customers were 
using relative to what products were purchased. It also gave specific insight into how many calls were being made to a
certain API and how that tied back to the current opportunity. This script transformed a manual task, that took roughly 
38 hours of work per month for our team, into an automated report. It allowed us to identify churn risks and opportunities 
for growth.

I wrote lines 137-295 with mentorship from a co-worker and collaborated with another co-worker to complete the remainder
of the script.
